# Python Operators

In Python, operators are special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. Here are the main types of operators and their definitions:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values.

- **`+`**: Addition - Adds two values.
- **`-`**: Subtraction - Subtracts one value from another.
- **`*`**: Multiplication - Multiplies two values.
- **`/`**: Division - Divides one value by another.
- **`%`**: Modulus - Returns the remainder of a division.
- **`**`**: Exponentiation - Raises one value to the power of another.
- **`//`**: Floor Division - Divides one value by another and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They also allow you to perform an operation and assign the result to the same variable.

- **`=`**: Assign - Assigns a value to a variable.
- **`+=`**: Add and Assign - Adds a value to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- **`-=`**: Subtract and Assign - Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- **`*=`**: Multiply and Assign - Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
- **`/=`**: Divide and Assign - Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
- **`%=`**: Modulus and Assign - Applies modulus operation and assigns the result to the variable.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.

- **`==`**: Equal to - Returns `True` if two values are equal.
- **`!=`**: Not equal to - Returns `True` if two values are not equal.
- **`>`**: Greater than - Returns `True` if the left value is greater than the right value.
- **`<`**: Less than - Returns `True` if the left value is less than the right value.
- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to - Returns `True` if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
- **`<=`**: Less than or equal to - Returns `True` if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations and combine boolean values.

- **`and`**: Logical AND - Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.
- **`or`**: Logical OR - Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.
- **`not`**: Logical NOT - Returns `True` if the condition is `False`.

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects.

- **`is`**: Is - Returns `True` if two variables point to the same object in memory.
- **`is not`**: Is not - Returns `True` if two variables do not point to the same object in memory.

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a value is a member of a collection (like a list, tuple, or set).

- **`in`**: In - Returns `True` if a value is found in the collection.
- **`not in`**: Not in - Returns `True` if a value is not found in the collection.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of integers.

- **`&`**: Bitwise AND - Performs AND operation on each bit of two numbers.
- **`|`**: Bitwise OR - Performs OR operation on each bit of two numbers.
- **`^`**: Bitwise XOR - Performs XOR operation on each bit of two numbers.
- **`~`**: Bitwise NOT - Inverts the bits of the number.
- **`<<`**: Bitwise left shift - Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
- **`>>`**: Bitwise right shift - Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
