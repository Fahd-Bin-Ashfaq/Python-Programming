## Overview

Understanding how to use comments and variables is essential for writing effective Python programs. Comments help explain the code, while variables are used to store data.

## Comments

### Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with a `#` and extend to the end of the line. They are used to provide brief explanations or notes within the code.
