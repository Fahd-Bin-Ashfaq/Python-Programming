## Python Data Types: List, Set, Tuple, and Dictionary

### 2. Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A **set** is one of the 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. The other 3 are **List**, **Tuple**, and **Dictionary**, each with different qualities and usage.

A **set** is a collection that is:
- **Unordered**: The items have no defined order.
- **Unchangeable***: The items cannot be modified after the set is created.
- **Unindexed**: The items do not have an index.

*Note: Although the items themselves cannot be changed, new items can be added or removed from the set.
```Python
myset={10,20,"Ali","Zain"}
print(myste)
print(types(set))

```
### Practice Questions for Sets
**Basic Operations:**

Create a set of your favorite colors. Add a new color to the set and then remove one color from the set. Print the updated set.
Write a Python program to find the number of items in a set using the built-in len() function.

## Set Methods:

Given two sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, write a Python program to find their union and intersection.
Write a Python program to check if one set is a subset of another set.

## Manipulating Sets:

Write a Python program to remove an element from a set using the discard() method. What happens if the element does not exist in the set?
Create two sets and write a Python program to find their symmetric difference.

## Set Comprehension:

Write a set comprehension that creates a set of the squares of all odd numbers from 0 to 10.
Given a set of strings, write a set comprehension to create a new set with only the strings that start with the letter 'a'.

## Advanced Operations:

Write a Python program to remove all elements from a set.
Given a set of numbers, write a Python program to find the maximum and minimum values in the set.

## Using Sets to Solve Problems:

Write a Python program that takes two lists and returns a set of all the elements that are present in both lists.
Given a list of words, write a Python program to find all unique words using a set.

## Converting Between Data Types:

Write a Python program to convert a list to a set and then back to a list. Explain why this might be useful.
Given a string, write a Python program to convert it into a set of characters.
