## Python Data Types: List, Set, Tuple, and Dictionary

### 1. List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
Lists are created using square brackets []

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(fruits)) #Class List
print(lent(fruits)) #2

# Accessing list items
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Adding an item to the list
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

## Here are some practice questions for Python lists:

*Practice Questions*
## Basic Operations:

Create a list of your favorite fruits. Add a new fruit to the list and then remove one fruit from the list. Print the updated list.
Write a Python program to find the length of a list without using the built-in len() function.

## Accessing Elements:

Given the list numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], write a Python program to access the third element.
Write a Python program to access the last element of a list using negative indexing.

## Slicing and Modifying Lists:

Write a Python program to reverse a list using slicing.
Given a list colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"], write a program to replace "blue" with "orange".

## List Methods:

Write a Python program to count the occurrences of a specific element in a list.
Create a list of numbers and write a Python program to sort the list in descending order.

## Comprehensions:

Write a list comprehension that creates a list of the squares of all even numbers from 0 to 20.
Given a list of strings, write a list comprehension to create a new list with only the strings that have more than 3 characters.

## Nested Lists:

Create a nested list (a list inside another list) and write a program to access an element from the inner list.
Write a Python program to flatten a nested list (convert it into a single list with no nested lists).

## Advanced Operations:

Write a Python program to remove all occurrences of a specific value from a list without using a loop.
Given two lists, write a Python program to merge them into a dictionary where elements from the first list are keys and elements from the second list are values.

These questions cover various aspects of working with lists in Python and should provide a good range of practice.
