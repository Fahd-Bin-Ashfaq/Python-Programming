## Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code. They allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for a conditional statement is:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the second condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
