# Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code. They allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for a conditional statement is:

```python

if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the second condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
```
## Practice Questions: Conditional Statements in Python

### 1. Basic Condition
Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message based on the result.

### 2. Even or Odd

- 90 to 100: A
- 80 to 89: B
- 70 to 79: C
- 60 to 69: D
- Below 60: F

### 4. Age Category

- Child (0-12)
- Teenager (13-19)
- Adult (20-64)
- Senior (65 and above)
