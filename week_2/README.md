# Python Built-in Data Types

In programming, data types are crucial because they define the kind of data a variable can store and how it can be used. Python has several built-in data types that are categorized as follows:

## Text Type
- **`str`**: Represents a string of characters.

## Numeric Types
- **`int`**: Represents integer numbers.
- **`float`**: Represents floating-point numbers (decimals).
- **`complex`**: Represents complex numbers (numbers with a real and imaginary part).

## Sequence Types
- **`list`**: An ordered, mutable collection of items.
- **`tuple`**: An ordered, immutable collection of items.
- **`range`**: Represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.

## Mapping Type
- **`dict`**: A collection of key-value pairs (dictionary).

## Set Types
- **`set`**: An unordered collection of unique items.
- **`frozenset`**: An immutable version of a set.

## Boolean Type
- **`bool`**: Represents boolean values `True` or `False`.

## Binary Types
- **`bytes`**: Immutable sequence of bytes.
- **`bytearray`**: Mutable sequence of bytes.
- **`memoryview`**: A view object that exposes an array's buffer interface.

## None Type
- **`NoneType`**: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

## Getting the Data Type

You can find out the data type of any object by using the `type()` function:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
