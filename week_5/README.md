# Loops in Programming

Loops are structures in programming that allow a set of instructions to be repeated multiple times. There are two common types of loops:

1. **For Loops**
2. **While Loops**

## While Loop

A `while` loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

### Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop

```python
counter = 1
while counter <= 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```
## For Loop
A `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It typically iterates over a sequence (like a range of numbers).

### Example: Print numbers from 1 to 9 using a for loop
```
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
```

### Practice Questions

1. **Print Even Numbers:**
   Write a `for` loop that prints all even numbers between 2 and 20.

2. **Sum of Numbers:**
   Write a `while` loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

3. **Factorial Calculation:**
   Write a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number `n`.

4. **Multiplication Table:**
   Write a `for` loop that prints the multiplication table for a number `n` from 1 to 10.

5. **Count Down:**
   Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.
