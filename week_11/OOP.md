**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is a programming approach based on class and object

OOP is a programing methodology focusing on real world entity


### Pillars of OOP:
- **Class & Object**: Fundamental building blocks of OOP. A class defines a blueprint for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, restricting access to some of the object's components.
- **Inheritance**: Allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Enables one action to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon, allowing for flexibility in code.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

### Programming Paradigms

There are several programming paradigms or styles that provide different ways of thinking about and structuring code. Here are the most common ones:

- **Procedural Programming**: 
  - This is one of the simplest and oldest ways of programming. It focuses on a sequence of instructions or procedures to be executed.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: 
  - Focuses on creating objects that represent real-world entities.

- **Functional Programming**: 
  - focuse on  the useing of functions and avoids dublication in the code
